## 🔧 About Me
👋 Hi, I'm **Piyush Singh** — an aspiring **Mechanical Design Engineer** passionate about transforming ideas into precise, functional designs.  
I've completed my **Diploma in Mechanical Engineering** and am currently advancing my skills through the **HCL Tech Design Program at GUVI GeeksforGeeks**.  
This repository showcases my dedication to continuous learning, practical design work, and building a strong foundation for my engineering career.

🎯 **My Mission**: To bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application through hands-on design projects.

🔧 **Current Focus**:  
- Advanced CAD Modeling (SolidWorks, CATIA)  
- Design for Manufacturing (DFM) & Assembly (DFA)  
- Mechanical Systems & Mechanisms  
- Industry-Standard Documentation  
- Preparing for FEA & Simulation (ANSYS - Coming Soon)

## 💭 My Engineering Philosophy

> *"Precision in design, excellence in execution, innovation in thinking."*
> 
> I believe great mechanical design isn't just about creating parts that work — it's about engineering solutions that are elegant, efficient, and exceed expectations. Every project is an opportunity to learn, improve, and push the boundaries of what's possible.
